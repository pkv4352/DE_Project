This project is all about connecting with postgreSQL using a package called psycopg2
What I did was
1)Made a connection to postgreSQL server with psycopg2 package and created a database in the server
2) Also created tables in the database and inserted data in them.
3)All these were executed in a python language in jupyter notebook.
